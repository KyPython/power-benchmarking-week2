# Documentation Index

**Single Responsibility**: Navigation guide and purpose definitions for all documentation files.

## Documentation Principles

All documentation follows the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - each file serves one distinct, long-term purpose. Documents are organized by audience and purpose.

## Long-Term Value

Each document:
- ✅ Serves a distinct purpose (no redundancy)
- ✅ Remains relevant over time (not one-time snapshots)
- ✅ Provides value to target audience
- ✅ Follows SRP (one clear responsibility)

**Total**: 10 documentation files (plus root README.md), all serving distinct, long-term purposes.
