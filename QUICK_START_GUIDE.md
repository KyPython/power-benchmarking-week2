- [ ] **sudo access** (for powermetrics)
  - Check: `sudo -v` (should prompt for password, not error)
- [ ] **Internet connection** (for installing dependencies)
- [ ] **~5 GB free disk space** (for dependencies and models)

**If any check fails, see "Troubleshooting" section at the end.**

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Installation (15-20 minutes)

### 1.1 Clone the Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your preferred directory
cd ~/Projects  # or wherever you keep projects

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KyPython/power-benchmarking-week2.git
cd power-benchmarking-week2
```

**Expected output**: Repository cloned successfully

**If you see errors**: Check internet connection, ensure git is installed (`git --version`)

### 1.2 Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# You should see (venv) in your prompt
```

**Why?** Isolates dependencies from system Python

**If you see errors**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed (`python3 --version`)

### 1.3 Install Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip first
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected output**: All packages installed successfully

**Common issues:**
- `coremltools` fails: Ensure you're on macOS with Apple Silicon
- `torch` fails: May take 5-10 minutes, be patient
- Permission errors: Don't use `sudo` with pip in virtual environment

**Time check**: Should take 5-15 minutes depending on internet speed

### 1.4 Install the Package

```bash
# Install in development mode (editable)
pip install -e .
```

**Expected output**: Package installed successfully

**Verify installation:**
```bash
power-benchmark --help
```

**Expected output**: Should show help menu with all commands

**If command not found**: 
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Try: `python3 -m power_benchmarking_suite.cli --help`

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Verify Installation (5 minutes)

### 2.1 Check Premium Status

```bash
power-benchmark --premium-status
```

**Expected output**:
```
💎 PREMIUM STATUS
Tier: FREE
📋 FREE TIER LIMITS:
   max_devices: 1
   max_duration_hours: 1
   ...
```

**If you see errors**: Installation may be incomplete, re-run `pip install -e .`

### 2.2 Test Component Detection

```bash
# Check if powermetrics is available
which powermetrics

# Should output: /usr/bin/powermetrics
```

**If not found**: You're not on macOS or powermetrics is missing (unlikely)

### 2.3 Quick Component Test

```bash
# Run component test (no sudo needed)
python3 scripts/test_components.py
```

**Expected output**: All components detected successfully

**If tests fail**: See troubleshooting section

---

## 🎬 Step 3: Your First Benchmark (20-30 minutes)

### 3.1 Convert Model (If Needed)

**Skip this if you already have `MobileNetV2.mlpackage`**

```bash
# Convert PyTorch model to CoreML
python3 scripts/convert_model.py
```

**Expected output**: 
```
✅ Model converted successfully
✅ Saved to: MobileNetV2.mlpackage
```

**Time**: 2-5 minutes (downloads model if needed)

**If you see errors**:
- `torch` not found: Re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Network errors: Check internet connection (model downloads from internet)

### 3.2 Run Your First Benchmark (30 seconds)

```bash
# Run 30-second test benchmark
sudo power-benchmark unified --test 30
```

**What to expect**:
- Terminal will show real-time power statistics
- May see "⚠️ Arduino not connected" (this is OK)
- After 30 seconds, you'll see a summary report

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Real-Time Statistics
Current Power: 1234.5 mW
Inferences: 150
Throughput: 5.0 inf/sec
...
```

**If you see errors**:
- `Permission denied`: Use `sudo`
- `powermetrics not found`: You're not on macOS
- `Model not found`: Run Step 3.1 first

**Time check**: Should complete in ~30 seconds

### 3.3 Understand the Output

**Key metrics to look for**:

1. **Current Power** (mW): Real-time ANE power consumption
2. **Mean/Median Power**: Average power during benchmark
3. **Inference Count**: Number of inferences completed
4. **Throughput**: Inferences per second

**What good results look like**:
- Mean power: 800-2000 mW (depends on workload)
- Throughput: 1000-3000 inf/sec (for MobileNetV2)
- Stable power: Low variance (std < 200 mW)

---

## 📊 Step 4: Visualize Your Data (15-20 minutes)

### 4.1 Generate Power Log

```bash
# Run benchmark and save to CSV (1 minute)
sudo power-benchmark logger --duration 60 --output my_first_benchmark.csv
```

**Expected output**: CSV file created with power data

**If file not created**: Check write permissions in current directory

### 4.2 Visualize the Data

```bash
# Generate visualization
power-benchmark visualize --csv my_first_benchmark.csv
```

**Expected output**: 
- PNG graph file created (e.g., `my_first_benchmark.png`)
- Terminal shows "✅ Graph saved to: ..."

**Open the graph**: `open my_first_benchmark.png` (macOS)

**What to look for**:
- Power over time (should show stable pattern)
- Statistical annotations (mean, median, std)
- Any anomalies (sudden spikes/drops)

### 4.3 Interpret the Results

**Good power profile**:
- ✅ Stable power consumption (low variance)
- ✅ Mean ≈ Median (symmetric distribution)
- ✅ No sudden spikes or drops

**Concerning patterns**:
- ⚠️ High variance (std > 300 mW): Background interference
- ⚠️ Mean >> Median: Right-skewed (bursty behavior)
- ⚠️ Mean << Median: Left-skewed (background tasks interfering)

**See `docs/TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md` for detailed interpretation**

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Analyze an Application (20-30 minutes)

### 5.1 Choose an App to Analyze

**Good candidates**:
- Safari (browser)
- Chrome (browser)
- Xcode (if installed)
- Terminal (lightweight)

### 5.2 Run App Analysis

```bash
# Analyze Safari power consumption (60 seconds)
sudo power-benchmark analyze --app Safari --duration 60
```

**What happens**:
1. Script finds Safari processes
2. Monitors power for 60 seconds
3. Calculates attribution ratio
4. Generates report

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Application Power Analysis: Safari
Duration: 60 seconds
Attribution Ratio: 45.2%
Mean Power: 1234.5 mW
...
```

**If you see errors**:
- `App not found`: App name is case-sensitive, try exact name
- `No PIDs found`: App may not be running, open it first
- `Permission denied`: Use `sudo`

### 5.3 Compare Two Apps

```bash
# Run analysis for first app
sudo power-benchmark analyze --app Safari --duration 30

# Run analysis for second app
sudo power-benchmark analyze --app Chrome --duration 30

# Compare the Attribution Ratios
```

**What to compare**:
- Attribution Ratio (higher = app uses more power)
- Mean Power (lower = more efficient)
- Power variance (lower = more stable)

---

## 🎓 Step 6: Understanding the Metrics (15-20 minutes)

### 6.1 Key Concepts

**Attribution Ratio (AR)**:
- Formula: `AR = (App_Power - Baseline) / (Total_Power - Baseline)`
- Meaning: What % of power is from the app vs. system
- Good range: 30-70% (depends on app type)

**Skewness**:
- **Left-skewed** (Mean < Median): Background tasks interfering
- **Right-skewed** (Mean > Median): Bursty app behavior
- **Symmetric** (Mean ≈ Median): Stable, predictable power

**Burst Fraction**:
- Meaning: % of time app is in high-power state
- Good range: < 20% for battery life
- High (> 50%): App is power-hungry

### 6.2 Read the Documentation

**Essential reading** (15 minutes):
1. `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Command cheat sheet
2. `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` - Understanding benchmark results
3. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the system works

**Advanced reading** (optional, 30+ minutes):
- `docs/TECHNICAL_DEEP_DIVE.md` - Deep technical concepts
- `docs/VALIDATION.md` - Validation scripts

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Command not found: power-benchmark"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall package
pip install -e . --force-reinstall

# Verify installation
which power-benchmark
```

**If still not found**: Use `python3 -m power_benchmarking_suite.cli` instead

### Issue 2: "Permission denied" for powermetrics

**Solution**:
```bash
# Always use sudo for powermetrics
sudo power-benchmark unified --test 30

# If sudo still fails, check sudo access
sudo -v
```

**If sudo fails**: Contact system administrator

### Issue 3: "Module not found" errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Reinstall package
pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

### Issue 4: "Model not found" or "MobileNetV2.mlpackage not found"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Convert the model
python3 scripts/convert_model.py

# Verify model exists
ls -la MobileNetV2.mlpackage/
```

**If conversion fails**: Check internet connection (model downloads)

### Issue 5: "Arduino not connected" warning

**This is OK!** Arduino is optional. The benchmark works without it.

**To use Arduino** (optional):
1. Upload `scripts/arduino_power_receiver.ino` to Arduino
2. Connect via USB
3. Run benchmark - data will stream automatically

### Issue 6: High power variance or unstable readings

**Possible causes**:
- Background processes interfering
- Thermal throttling
- System under load

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check for background processes
top -l 1 | head -20

# Close unnecessary apps
# Re-run benchmark

# Use intelligent baseline detector
python3 scripts/intelligent_baseline_detector.py
```

### Issue 7: "Duration exceeds free tier limit"

**Solution**:
```bash
# Free tier: 1 hour max per session
# For testing, enable premium features (dev only)
power-benchmark enable-premium-test

# Or upgrade to premium
power-benchmark --upgrade
```

### Issue 8: Visualization fails or graph is empty

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check CSV file exists and has data
head my_first_benchmark.csv

# Check file has power data columns
# Should see: timestamp, ane_power_mw, cpu_power_mw, etc.

# Re-run visualization with verbose output
power-benchmark visualize --csv my_first_benchmark.csv --output graph.png
```
