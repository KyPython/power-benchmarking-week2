# Cursor AI Behavior Rules

## Documentation & File Creation
- **STOP** creating new markdown (.md) files for every single change, task completion, or status update.
- **EVALUATE** the long-term value before creating any new file. Ask: "Will this file be useful in 6 months, or is it just noise?"
- **ONLY** create or update documentation if:
  1. Explicitly requested by the user.
  2. It is a necessary update to core documentation (e.g., README.md, API docs).
  3. The change involves a complex architectural decision that code comments cannot sufficiently explain.
- **AVOID** creating "implementation logs," "task lists," or "summary" files that become stale immediately.
- **MAINTENANCE**: Actively look for opportunities to delete or consolidate redundant MD files.
- **SRP (DOCS)**: Ensure every MD file follows the Single Responsibility Principle (one topic per file).

## Code Quality & Standards
- **STYLE**: Strictly adhere to the existing code style. Match indentation, naming conventions, and patterns found in the codebase.
- **THEMING**: Use the application's Theme Context. **BRANDING**: The brand color is BLUE. Ensure all publicly visible UI elements utilize the blue brand color via design tokens. Do NOT hardcode hex values.
- **OBSERVABILITY**: Integrate all logs into the centralized observability system. Do not use `console.log` directly; use the app's logger/telemetry service.
- **SRP (CODE)**: Apply Single Responsibility Principle strictly. Every function, method, and line of code must have a single, clear purpose.

## Architectural Integrity
- **IMPACT ANALYSIS**: Before generating code, evaluate the relationship with the rest of the app. Check for side effects, dependency cycles, and state consistency.
- **HOLISTIC REVIEW**: Ensure the solution fits the broader architecture. Don't just fix the local problem; ensure it aligns with the long-term system design.

## Hand-off & Independence
- **GUIDANCE**: At the end of a response, remind the user of the specific MD files or directories relevant to their daily job or current task.
- **EMPOWERMENT**: Provide clear pointers on where to go next so the user can continue independently without relying solely on the AI.

## General Behavior
- Prioritize editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Focus on self-documenting code and inline comments.
